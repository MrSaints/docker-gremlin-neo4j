# docker-gremlin-neo4j

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MrSaints/docker-gremlin-neo4j.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MrSaints/docker-gremlin-neo4j)


_A work in progress. Use at your own discretion._

An unofficial set of lightweight [Docker][docker], and [Docker Compose][docker-compose] files for working with [Apache TinkerPopâ„¢][tinkerpop] Gremlin Console, Gremlin Server, and [Neo4j][neo4j].

`org.apache.tinkerpop neo4j-gremlin` is installed out-of-the-box for both the console, and the server image (currently version `3.2.1`).


## Disclaimer

By default, most Gremlin Server configuration files will set the host binding to `localhost`. The Gremlin Server image in this repository uses a custom configuration file ([`gremlin-server-custom.yml`](gremlin-server-neo4j/conf/gremlin-server-custom.yml)) in order to bind to `0.0.0.0`. i.e. any 'host' can connect to it.


## TODO

- [ ] Clean up `docker-compose.yml`
- [ ] Improve configuration
- [ ] Make the Gremlin Server image useful
- [ ] Tag images


## Install

You can skip this step if you are working with Docker Compose.

    docker pull mrsaints/gremlin-console-neo4j
    docker pull mrsaints/gremlin-server-neo4j


## Usage

**Gremlin Console with Neo4j standalone:**

    docker-compose run --rm --service-ports gremlin-console-with-neo4j

**Neo4j only:**

    docker-compose run --rm --service-ports neo4j-server


## Development

The Docker images are automatically built, and pushed to [Docker Hub][docker-hub] via [Travis CI][travis-ci].
See [.travis.yml](.travis.yml) for more information.

**Build Docker images:**

See the respective files below for more information.

```bash
./bin/build-gremlin-console-neo4j.sh
./bin/build-gremlin-server-neo4j.sh
```


## Useful Console Commands

**Connect to remote Docker Compose service:**

The following command assumes that the console container, and the server container are linked. It should not be a problem if launched with the `gremlin-console-all` service.

    :remote connect tinkerpop.server conf/remote-docker-compose.yml
    :remote console

**Load Neo4j graph:**

The following command assumes that the `/data/` directory already contains Neo4j data, and that it has already been mounted between the host, and the console container.

    Neo4jGraph.open("/data/")

DO NOT link it to `/data/databases/graph.db` as it is not a valid path.
